# Authentication App
This is a mobile application built with React Native that provides user authentication functionality using Firebase as the backend service. It allows users to register an account, log in, and access protected resources.
# Features
User Registration: Users can create a new account by providing their email and password. Firebase handles the account creation and securely stores user credentials.

User Login: Registered users can log in to the app using their email and password credentials. Firebase verifies the login information and grants access upon successful authentication.

Protected Routes: Certain app screens or resources are restricted to authenticated users only. Users must be logged in to access these protected routes.

Firebase Integration: The app integrates with Firebase Authentication, which provides a secure and scalable backend service for user management and authentication.

Error Handling: The app includes error handling mechanisms to handle and display appropriate messages for various authentication scenarios, such as incorrect credentials or network errors.
